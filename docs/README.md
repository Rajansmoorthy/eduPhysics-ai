eduPhysics AI

eduPhysics AI is a concept-driven AI learning platform designed to support CBSE, NEET, and senior secondary Physics education through structured, safe, and governed AI interactions.

The project focuses on conceptual clarity, practical understanding, and exam-oriented learning, while maintaining strict controls on prompt architecture, safety, and governance.

🎯 Project Objectives

Support Physics learning for Classes 9–12, CBSE, and NEET aspirants

Assist teachers and institutions with structured AI-based guidance

Maintain safe, auditable, and non-leaking AI prompt design

Enable future expansion into school deployments and educator tools

🧱 Architecture Overview (High-Level)

This repository contains documentation and governance artifacts only.

Core prompt architecture is frozen

Safety and injection protections are explicitly documented

No executable code, API keys, or secrets are stored here

📌 Implementation layers (frontend, backend, deployment) are intentionally separated and not part of this repository at this stage.

🔒 Governance & Safety

This project follows a strict separation of concerns:

Prompt Architecture Freeze
Prevents scope drift, unauthorized changes, and instruction overrides.

Safety & Governance Rules
Protect against prompt injection, system overrides, and leakage.

Refer to:

docs/PROMPT_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md

docs/SAFETY_AND_GOVERNANCE.md

🚫 What This Repository Does NOT Contain

❌ API keys

❌ Executable backend code

❌ Frontend UI code

❌ Deployment configuration

❌ Model fine-tuning data

This is intentional and aligned with security best practices.

🛣 Roadmap (High Level)

Frontend MVP (separate repository)

Backend orchestration (secure environment)

Controlled model access via API

School and institutional pilots

Teacher-led onboarding workflows
